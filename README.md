### Highlighted Projects

- **Dictionary-based Hash Cracker (Java)**  
  Built a tool that takes a URL and generates a wordlist by scraping the website (using the JSoup library). It uses the wordlist to crack SHA256 hashes using a dictionary-based approach. Currently supports lowercase and uppercase letters and numbers. 

- **COVID Data Analysis (Python)**  
  Used `pandas` to clean and visualize COVID-19 data from CSVs; generated informative plots to understand trends.

- **3D Runner Game (Unity + C#)**  
  Designed and coded a fully playable game using Unity; includes object spawning, character animation, and collision logic.

### Achivements
